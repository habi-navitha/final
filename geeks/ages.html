   <h3> 1. The sum of ages of 5 children born at the intervals of 3 years each is 50 years. What is the age of the youngest child?</h3>
    <p>   A. 4<br>
       B. 8<br>
       C. 12<br>
       D. none of these<br></p>

    <b>Answer</b> Option A<br>
    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    Let the ages of children be x, (x + 3), (x + 6), (x + 9) and (x + 12) years.<br>
    Then, x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + (x + 9) + (x + 12) = 50<br>
    5x = 20<br>
    <br>
    x = 4.<br>


    <h3> 2.A father said to his son, "I was as old as you are at the present at the time of your birth". If the father's age is 38 years now, the son's age five years back was:</h3>
    <p>   A.14<br>
       B. 19<br>
       C. 33<br>
       D. 38<br></p>

    <b>Answer</b> Option A<br>
    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    Let the son's present age be x years. Then, (38 - x) = x<br>
     2x = 38.<br>
     x = 19.<br>
    <br>
     Son's age 5 years back (19 - 5) = 14 years.<br>

    <h3> 3. A is two years older than B who is twice as old as C. If the total of the ages of A, B and C be 27, then how old is B?</h3>
    <p>   A. 7<br>
        B. 8<br>
         C. 9<br>
         D. 10<br></p>
      
    <b>Answer</b> Option 10<br>
    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    Let C's age be x years. Then, B's age = 2x years. A's age = (2x + 2) years.<br>
    (2x + 2) + 2x + x = 27<br>
    5x = 25<br>
    x = 5.<br>
    <br>
    Hence, B's age = 2x = 10 years.<br>
