   <h3> 1. Statements: All bags are cakes. All lamps are cakes.<br>
    Conclusions:<br>

    Some lamps are bags.<br>
    No lamp is bag.<br> </h3>
    <p> A.  Only conclusion I follows<br>
        B. Only conclusion II follows<br>
        C. Either I or II follows<br>
        D. Neither I nor II follows<br>
        E. Both I and II follow<br> 
        

    <b>Answer</b> Option C<br>
    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    Since the middle term 'cakes' is not distributed even once in the premises, no definite conclusion follows. <BR> However, I and II involve only the extreme terms and form a complementary pair. So, either I or II follows.<BR>

    <h3> 2.Statements: All mangoes are golden in colour. No golden-coloured things are cheap.<br>

        Conclusions:<br>
        
        All mangoes are cheap<br>.
        Golden-coloured mangoes are not cheap.</h3>
    <p>   
        A. Only conclusion I follows<br>.
        B. Only conclusion II follows<br>.
        C. Either I or II follows<br>.
        D. Neither I nor II follows<br>.
        E. Both I and II follow</p>

    <b>Answer</b> Option D<br>
    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    Clearly, the conclusion must be universal negative and should not contain the middle term. <BR> So, it follows that 'No mango is cheap'. Since all mangoes are golden in colour, we may substitute 'mangoes' with 'golden-coloured mangoes'. Thus, II follows.


    <h3> 3. Statements: Some kings are queens. All queens are beautiful.<br>
        
        Conclusions:<br>
        
        All kings are beautiful.<br>
        All queens are kings.<br></h3>
    <p>   A. Only conclusion I follows<br>
          B. Only conclusion II follows<br>
          C. Either I or II follows<br>
          D. Neither I nor II follows<br>
          E. Both I and II follow<br></p>
      
    <b>Answer</b> Option D<br>
    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    Since one premise is particular, the conclusion must be particular. <BR> So, neither I nor II follows.
