   <h3> 1. Tickets numbered 1 to 20 are mixed up and then a ticket is drawn at random. What is the probability that the ticket drawn has a number which is a multiple of 3 or 5?</h3>
    <p>   A. 1/2<br>
       B. 2/5<br>
       C. 8/15<br>
       D. 9/20<br></p>

    <b>Answer</b> Option D<br>
    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    Here, S = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...., 19, 20}.<br>
    
    Let E = event of getting a multiple of 3 or 5 = {3, 6 , 9, 12, 15, 18, 5, 10, 20}.<br>
    
     P(E) =	n(E) =	9.<br>
    n(S)20<br>

    <h3> 2.Three unbiased coins are tossed. What is the probability of getting at most two heads?</h3>
    <p>   A. 3/4<br>
       B. 1/4<br>
       C. 3/8<br>
       D. 7/8<br></p>

    <b>Answer</b> Option D<br>
    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    Here S = {TTT, TTH, THT, HTT, THH, HTH, HHT, HHH} <br>
    Let E = event of getting at most two heads.<br>
    <br>
    Then E = {TTT, TTH, THT, HTT, THH, HTH, HHT}. <br>
          p(E)= n(E)/n(S)<br>
             =7/8

    <h3> 3. A bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?</h3>
    <p>   A. 10/21<br>
        B. 11/21<br>
         C. 2/7<br>
         D. 5/7<br></p>
      
    <b>Answer</b> Option A<br>
    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    Total number of balls = (2 + 3 + 2) = 7.<br>
    Let S be the sample space.<br>
    <br>
    Then, n(S)	= Number of ways of drawing 2 balls out of 7 <br>
         =	(7 x 6) <br>
            (2 x 1)<br>
         = 21.<br>
