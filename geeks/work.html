   <h3> 1. A, B and C can do a piece of work in 20, 30 and 60 days respectively. In how many days can A do the work if he is assisted by B and C on every third day?</h3>
    <p>   A. 12<br>
       B. 15<br>
       C. 16<br>
       D. 18<br></p>

    <b>Answer</b> Option B<br>
    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    A's 2 day's work =(1/20 *2) = 1/10<br>
    
    Work done in 3 days =(1/10 + 1/10 ) = 1/5<br>
    <BR>
    Whole work will be done in (3 x 5) = 15 days.<br>
    

    <h3> 2.A can do a piece of work in 4 hours; B and C together can do it in 3 hours, while A and C together can do it in 2 hours. How long will B alone take to do it?</h3>
    <p>   A. 8<br>
       B. 10<br>
       C. 12<br>
       D. 24<br></p>

    <b>Answer</b> Option C<br>
    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    A's 1 hour's work =	1/4 <br>
    (A + B + C)'s 1 hour's work =(1/4 + 1/3 ) = 7/12<br>
    <br>
    B alone will take 12 hours to do the work.

    <h3> 3.
        A can do a certain work in the same time in which B and C together can do it. If A and B together could do it in 10 days and C alone in 50 days, then B alone could do it in:</h3>
    <p>   A. 15<br>
        B. 20<br>
         C. 25<br>
         D. 30<br></p>
      
    <b>Answer</b> Option A<br>
    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    
(A + B)'s 1 day's work =1/10<br>
    C's 1 day's work =	1/10<br>
    <br>
    A's 1 day's work = (B + C)'s 1 day's work  <br>
    A's 1 day's work =	3/50 <br>
    So, B alone could do the work in 25 days.<br>
